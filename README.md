# MyCoRe Prerendering for Wavesurfer 

Just throw the jar in your mycore home lib directory.

If a file is created or updated matches one of the comma separated mimetypes in `MCR.Wavesurfer.MimeType=` then 
a WaveSurfer file is generated.

You can request them with `/rsc/wavesurfer/xyz_derivate_00000005/file.mp3.json`.
